# Firebase Forgot Password Integration

This document explains how the Firebase forgot password functionality is integrated into the Bachat app.

## Overview

The app now uses Firebase's native password reset functionality instead of the custom OTP system. This provides a more secure and reliable password reset experience.

## Components

### 1. Authentication Service (`authService.ts`)

The `authService.ts` file contains all Firebase authentication operations including:

- `sendPasswordReset(email)`: Sends a password reset email to the user
- `confirmPasswordReset(actionCode, newPassword)`: Confirms the password reset using the action code from the email
- `signIn(email, password)`: User sign in
- `signUp(email, password)`: User registration
- `updatePassword(currentPassword, newPassword)`: Update password for authenticated users
- `signOut()`: Sign out user

### 2. Forgot Password Screen (`forgot-password.tsx`)

- User enters their email address
- Validates email format
- Sends password reset email via Firebase
- Shows success/error messages
- Redirects to login after successful email send

### 3. Reset Password Screen (`reset-password.tsx`)

- Handles the password reset link from email
- Extracts action code from URL parameters
- Allows user to enter new password
- Confirms password reset with Firebase
- Shows success/error messages

## Flow

1. **User requests password reset**:
   - User goes to forgot password screen
   - Enters email address
   - Clicks "Send Reset Link"
   - Firebase sends password reset email

2. **User receives email**:
   - Email contains a secure reset link
   - Link includes an action code (oobCode)
   - User clicks the link

3. **User resets password**:
   - App opens reset password screen
   - Action code is extracted from URL
   - User enters new password
   - Firebase confirms the reset

4. **Success**:
   - Password is updated in Firebase
   - User can sign in with new password

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Invalid email addresses
- Non-existent accounts
- Expired reset links
- Network errors
- Too many requests
- Invalid action codes

## Security Features

- **Action Code Validation**: Firebase validates the reset link before allowing password change
- **Link Expiration**: Reset links expire automatically (default: 1 hour)
- **One-time Use**: Each reset link can only be used once
- **Email Verification**: Only registered email addresses can request resets

## Configuration

### Firebase Console Setup

1. **Enable Email/Password Authentication**:
   - Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable Email/Password provider

2. **Configure Password Reset Email**:
   - Go to Authentication > Templates
   - Customize the password reset email template
   - Set the action URL to your app's reset password screen

3. **Action URL Configuration**:
   - Set the action URL to: `your-app-scheme://reset-password`
   - This will open your app when users click the reset link

### App Configuration

The reset password screen expects the action code in the URL parameters:

```typescript
const { oobCode } = useLocalSearchParams();
```

## Testing

### Development Testing

1. **Send Reset Email**:
   - Use a real email address
   - Check console logs for Firebase operations
   - Verify email is received

2. **Test Reset Flow**:
   - Click the reset link in the email
   - Verify the app opens to reset password screen
   - Test password validation
   - Confirm password reset works

### Production Testing

1. **Email Delivery**: Ensure emails are delivered to various email providers
2. **Link Expiration**: Test that expired links are properly handled
3. **Security**: Verify that invalid action codes are rejected
4. **User Experience**: Test the complete flow from forgot password to successful login

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not received**:
   - Check spam folder
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Check Firebase console for delivery status

2. **Reset link not working**:
   - Verify action URL configuration
   - Check if link has expired
   - Ensure app can handle deep links

3. **Password reset fails**:
   - Check action code validity
   - Verify password meets requirements
   - Check Firebase console for errors

### Debug Information

Enable Firebase debug logging:

```typescript
// In your app initialization
import { setLogLevel } from 'firebase/app';
setLogLevel('debug');
```

## Migration from OTP System

The app previously used a custom OTP system for password reset. The new Firebase integration provides:

- **Better Security**: Uses Firebase's secure action codes
- **Simplified Flow**: No need for OTP verification
- **Reliability**: Firebase handles email delivery and validation
- **Standard Compliance**: Follows industry best practices

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Custom Email Templates**: Brand the reset emails with your app's design
2. **Additional Security**: Add CAPTCHA for reset requests
3. **Analytics**: Track password reset success rates
4. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on the reset experience
