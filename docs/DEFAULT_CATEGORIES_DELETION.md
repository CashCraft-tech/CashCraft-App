# Default Categories Deletion Feature

## Overview

Users can now delete **all categories** including the predefined default ones, with only the "Others" category being protected from deletion.

## Changes Made

### **1. Updated Delete Button Visibility**

**Before:**
```typescript
{!cat.isDefault && cat.name !== 'Others' && (
  <TouchableOpacity style={styles.catAction} onPress={() => handleDelete(idx)}>
    <Ionicons name="trash" size={16} color={theme.error} />
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{cat.name !== 'Others' && (
  <TouchableOpacity style={styles.catAction} onPress={() => handleDelete(idx)}>
    <Ionicons name="trash" size={16} color={theme.error} />
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

### **2. Enhanced Delete Confirmation**

**Before:**
```typescript
Alert.alert(
  'Delete Category',
  `Are you sure you want to delete "${categoryToDelete.name}"? All transactions in this category will be moved to "Others".`,
  // ...
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Show different message for default categories
const isDefault = categoryToDelete.isDefault;
const message = isDefault 
  ? `Are you sure you want to delete the default category "${categoryToDelete.name}"? All transactions in this category will be moved to "Others". You can always recreate it later.`
  : `Are you sure you want to delete "${categoryToDelete.name}"? All transactions in this category will be moved to "Others".`;

Alert.alert('Delete Category', message, // ...);
```

### **3. Updated Tips Section**
